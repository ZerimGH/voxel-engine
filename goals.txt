LONG TERM (im putting these off):
  - Block lighting (BFS / Djikstras)
  - Chunk-face culling for the simple mesher 
  - Chunk saving / Loading
  - Entities, player model, animations

SHORT TERM (i will do these soon):
  - Player inventory / hotbar + ui
  - Fix greedy mesher (Weird bug where some pixels of the background show
    through the mesh)
  - Cloud rendering, fog
  - Better terrain generation (biomes, trees, ores)

RIGHT NOW (i am working on this):
  - Lower memory usage (represent block types as uint8_t, optimise mesh
    lifetime, maybe even some vertex packing)

DONE: 
  - Render cube
  - Camera movement from input
  - Chunk meshing / rendering
  - Chunk terrain gen
  - Different textures for different blocks and faces
  - Gradient sky rendering
  - Chunk manager (loading / unloading + meshing)
  - Multithreading
  - Player physics / movement
